**Welcome to the Open-EP (E-Paper) Community!**

We provide a wide range of tiny e-paper modules in various interfaces and sizes. All of our sample code is open-source and supports multiple platforms. In addition, we offer a Linux Kernel DRM driver, enabling our e-paper modules to function not only as peripheral devices but also as primary displays.
